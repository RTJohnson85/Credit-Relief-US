                    <p class="text-start text-dark">To protect Personal Information from unauthorized access and use, we
                        use security measures that comply with applicable federal and state laws. These measures may
                        include device safeguards and secured files and buildings as well as oversight of our third
                        party service providers to ensure information remains confidential and secure. While we follow

                    <p class="text-start text-dark">Other companies offer aggregation websites and services that allow
                        you to consolidate your financial account information from different sources (such as your
                        accounts with us or with other financial institutions) so that you can view all your account
                        information at one online location. To do this, an aggregation provider may request access to
                        Personal Information, such as financial information, usernames and passwords. You should use
                        caution and ensure that the aggregator company has appropriate policies and practices to protect
                        the privacy and security of any information you provide or to which they are gaining access. We
                        are not responsible for the use or disclosure of any Personal Information accessed by any
                        company or person to whom you provide your Site username and password.</p>
                    <p class="text-start text-dark">If you provide your Site username, password or other information
                        about your accounts with us to an aggregation website, we will consider that you have authorized
                        all transactions or actions initiated by an aggregation website using access information you
                        provide, whether or not you were aware of a specific transaction or action. If you decide to
                        revoke the authority you have given to an aggregation website, we strongly recommend that you
                        change your password for the Site to ensure that the aggregation website cannot continue to
                        access your account.</p>

                    <h5 class="text-start text-dark mt-5">Making sure information is accurate</h5>
